# Getting Started

Welcome to MS2LDA! This quick guide helps you take your first steps into discovering interesting substructures in your data. So, let us install and use the tool, whether you're working through the web interface or the command line.

## Inputs & Outputs üì•üì§

### Input
MS2LDA expects **preprocessed MS/MS data**, typically in:

- `.mgf`  (Mascot Generic Format)
- `.mzML` (via conversion or direct input)
- `.msp`  (NIST-style spectrum libraries)

### Output
After processing, MS2LDA provides:

- **Mass2Motifs** (discovered substructure patterns)
- **Spectra-motif loadings**
- Optional annotations via: **MotifDB** or **MAG**

Output formats:

- CSV tables
- JSON (for advanced integration)
- Visualizations (interactive in web app)

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

**Note:** These instructions assume a Linux or macOS terminal environment with **Conda** installed. Windows users can follow along using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a Unix-like shell:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vdhooftcompmet/MS2LDA.git

# Load MS2LDA directory
cd MS2LDA
```
Now we will create a Conda environment using a **YAML configuration file (.yml)** included in the repository that specifies all the required Python packages and dependencies to run MS2LDA smoothly.

```bash
# Create a conda environment 
``conda env create -f MS2LDA_environment.yml``

``conda activate MS2LDA_v2``
```

## Viz App vs Command-Line

For detailed information on how to run your analysis through the MS2LDAViz app please check: [MS2LDAViz App guide](../guide/MS2LDAViz_App.md)

For detailed information on how to run your analysis from the commnad-line please check: [MS2LDA Command Line](../guide/MS2LDA_Command_Line.md)
