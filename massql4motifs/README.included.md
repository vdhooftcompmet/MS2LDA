## Source Information

## Why This Package is Included Here
This package has been copied and included directly in MS2LDA to enable distribution on PyPI (Python Package Index). PyPI requires all dependencies to be available on PyPI itself, but massql4motifs is not yet published there. By including it directly, we can distribute MS2LDA as a complete package that users can install with pip.

## License
This included code is distributed under the same license as the original MassQueryLanguage4Mass2Motifs project. See LICENSE.txt in the original repository.

## Future Plans
This inclusion is temporary. When massql4motifs is published to PyPI or when motif support is merged into the upstream MassQL project, we will remove this copied version and use the official package instead.

## Updating This Included Copy
To update this included copy with newer changes:
1. Clone the source repository at the desired version
2. Copy the massql4motifs directory to this location
3. Update the version hash and date in this file
4. Test that all functionality still works
