Structure elucidation is a major bottleneck in analytical chemistry and its progress influcences various research fields like natural product discovery and food safety. Mass spectrometry is one of the most used instruments for structure elucidation and identification with its information rich fragmentation patterns. To this date, only a fraction of this information is understood an can be related to structural features. For molecular properties as bioactivity substructures are the key parts. This implementation of MS2LDA is based on the idea of the orginal version published in 2017 and offers automated annotation as well as a desktop app for local data analysis.

## Installation

## TODO (Should be moved to the actions canvas)
- [ ] check tomotopy package and compare with Gensim; maybe ask Joe
- [ ] add documentary folder
- [ ] Create documentary (similar to MassQL (https://mwang87.github.io/MassQueryLanguage_Documentation/))
## Limitations
