**MS2LDA** is an advanced tool designed for unsupervised substructure discovery in mass spectrometry data, utilizing topic modeling and providing automated annotation of discovered motifs. This tool significantly enhances the capabilities described in the [original MS2LDA paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1608041113) (2016), offering users an integrated workflow with improved usability, detailed visualizations, and a searchable motif database (MotifDB).

Mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns hold abundant structural information vital for analytical chemistry, natural product research, and food safety assessments. However, interpreting this data remains challenging, and only a fraction of available information is traditionally utilized. MS2LDA addresses this by identifying recurring substructures (motifs) across spectral datasets without relying on prior compound identification, thus accelerating structure elucidation and analysis.

# MS2LDA Installation and Usage

You can set up MS2LDA using either **Conda** or **Poetry**, depending on your preferences and requirements.

## Installation Guides

We provide separate detailed documentation for each installation method:

- [**Conda Installation Guide**](README_CONDA.md) - Uses Conda environment management.
- [**Poetry Installation Guide**](README_POETRY.md) - Uses Poetry for dependency management.

## Command Line Tool Usage

MS2LDA provides powerful command-line tools for batch processing and analysis of mass spectrometry data.

For detailed instructions on using the command-line interface, see the [**Command Line Tool Guide**](README_CLI.md).
