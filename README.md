Structure elucidation is a major bottleneck in analytical chemistry and its progress influcences various research fields like natural product discovery and food safety. Mass spectrometry is one of the most used instruments for structure elucidation and identification with its information rich fragmentation patterns. To this date, only a fraction of this information is understood an can be related to structural features. For molecular properties as bioactivity substructures are the key parts. This implementation of MS2LDA is based on the idea of the orginal version published in 2017 and offers automated annotation, visualizations tools and a database for found Motifs (MotifDB).

## Installation

The installation process is twofold. <\br>
First the GitHub repository needs to be cloned. 
```git clone https://github.com/vdhooftcompmet/MS2LDA.git```
And all used models and datasets must be downloaded from **[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11394248)**.
Another repository called MassQueryLanguage4Mass2Motifs also need to be downloaded and installed. This repository is the modified MassQueryLanguage repository from XXX and therefore conflicts with this version.
